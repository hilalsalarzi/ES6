## Introduction

ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. It brought numerous enhancements to the JavaScript language, providing developers with a more modern and efficient way to write code. This repository serves as a resource for learning and exploring various ES6 features.

## Features

The examples in this repository cover a wide range of ES6 features, including but not limited to:

- Arrow Functions
- Classes and Inheritance
- Template Literals
- Destructuring
- Spread and Rest Operators
- Promises and Async/Await
- Modules
- and more...

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (with npm)
- A modern web browser

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples and projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hilalsalarzi/ES6.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd ES6
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Open the code files in your preferred code editor or IDE.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the ES6 features demonstrated in this repository:

1. **Arrow Functions:**

   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

2. **Classes and Inheritance:**

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }

     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Template Literals:**

   ```javascript
   const name = 'John';
   const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```
